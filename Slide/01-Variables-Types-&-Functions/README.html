1. Familiarize with Swift Playgrounds
1. Identify and create variables & constants
1. Identify and define types in Swift
1. Formulate and use functions to encapsulate code with parameters and return values
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Swift Intro

Swift is a programming language to write software for phones, wearables, desktops, servers, and much more.

It was released in June 2014 by Apple. The language is a combination of years of Apple engineering development and the contribution of an open-source community.

Swift is **beginner friendly, safe, fast, interactive** and optimized for **performance** and **development**.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Playgrounds

To learn a lot of the course content we will be using Playgrounds. It will be easy and fast to experiment without having to set up an app in Xcode.

**Xcode** is the environment where we build apps.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Playground Demo

- Identify sections
- Calculations
- Comments
- Print statements
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Playground sections

- **Source editor**: where we write code
- **Results sidebar**: shows results of code
- **Execution control**: manual or automatic
- **Activity viewer**: shows status of the playground
- **Panel controls**: toggle them on or off from the screen
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Comments

```swift
// This is a single line comment
```

```swift
/* This is a comment that can
   span over many lines.
   Like this.
*/
 ```

<aside class="notes">
Before we start writing code, it's important to know how you can document what you do. This is helpful for people who will later work with your code, or just you in the future. We can write comments to help us know why we wrote some code and this will be ignored by the compiler.
</aside>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Print to console

It's also useful to see what our code is doing. For this we use print statements. The results will print in the debug area or console.

```swift
print("Hello, you are ready to write some Swift")
```
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Constants

When we handle data in our code, we can give it a name and a type. This makes it easier to reference it later and manipulate it.

```swift
let months: Int = 12
```

<aside class="notes">
This is a constant. We declare a constant using `let` followed by the name we want to give that data, here it's `months`. We also set it's type to `Int` and assigned a value of 12. What comes after the colon is called a *type annotation*, you use this to be clear about the kind of values the constant can store.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The type **Int** can store integers.

```swift
let average: Double = 8.88
```

The type **Double** can store decimals with high precision.

The type **Float** can store decimals with less precision but takes up less memory.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Once we've declared a constant we can't change it's data. So this makes them useful for values that we know they won't change.

If by mistake you try to change the value of a constant, Xcode will throw an error message to let you know.

```swift
Cannot assign to value: 'number' is a 'let' constant
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Question

**Q1:** Will the following code snippet run without error? Justify your answer:

`let number: Double = 3`

<!--Yes, because the compiler will assign the value 3.0 to number-->
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Variables

What if we need to change the value? For example if we are tracking our bank account balance. Then we use a variable.

```swift
var accountBalance: Double = 8000.80
```
<aside class="notes">
It's very similar as a constant, but we declare it with the keyword `var`.

Constants are useful in cases when we know our data can change.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Naming

Choose names for your variables and constants that reflect what they are. This will help as documentation and to make your code readable.

|     Good     |      Bad      |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
| numberOfPets |      np       |
| username     |     usrnm     |
| borderColor  |     temp      |
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In Swift is common to use **camel case**.

- Start with lower case
- If the name has more than one word, start the next words with uppercase
- If there is an abbreviation, use the same case for it
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Questions

**Q1:** For a video game, which of the following would be best represented with a constant:

1. Player name <!--correct-->
1. Player level
1. Player score
1. Player location
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q2:** Which of the following would be best represented with a variable? Choose all that apply

1. Name
1. Birthday
1. Age <!--correct-->
1. Home Address <!--correct-->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q3:** ____ is used to declare a constant, and ______ is used to declare a variable:

1. `const`, `var`
1. `const`, `let`
1. `let`, `var` <!--correct-->
1. `var`, `let`
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Constant or Variable?

Imagine you're creating a simple photo sharing app. You want to keep track of the following metrics for each post:
- Number of likes: the number of likes that a photo has received
- Number of comments: the number of comments other users have left on the photo
- Year created: The year the post was created
- Month created: The month the post was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
- Day created: The day of the month the post was created

 For each of the metrics above, declare either a constant or a variable and assign it a value corresponding to a hypothetical post. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.

## In Class Activity - 25 min

In this playground we review the concepts learned so far, experiment using arithmetic operations and also learn about a new type: Strings.

[Variables - Swift Playgrounds](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Intro-Variables-Swift-Playground/archive/swift4.zip)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Type Casting

There can be times when we have data of a certain type but need to convert it to another.

```swift
var integer: Int = 20
var decimal: Double = 8.5

integer = Int(decimal)
```
<aside class="notes">
With these we say we want to convert from the original type, Double, to the new type, Int.
</aside>
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Type Inference

Every time we declare a new variable or constant we add a **type annotation**. If we do not include it and still assign a value, the Swift compiler can deduce the type. This is called **type inference**

```swift
let height = 155
```
<aside class="notes">
We can find something like this and assume that the compiler knows it's an Int. We can double check this by holding down the Option key ‚å• and clicking on the variable or constant name. Then we should see a popover telling us the inferred type.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Sometimes we need a variable to be a certain type even when assigning something different. Let's say we have this:

```swift
let height = 155
```

This would be assigned as an Int by the compiler. Here are several ways to fix it:

```swift
let height = Double(8)
let height : Double = 8
let height = 8 as Double
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Question

Using type inference, which of the following would be asssigned a `Double` type?

1. `var state = "Rhode Island"`
1. `let country = "Belgium"`
1. `let population = 142000`
1. `let speedLimit = 75.0` <!--correct-->
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other types

```swift
let char: Character = "a"
let string: String = "a string"
let cheesecakeLover: Bool = true
let coordinates: (Int, Int) = (1, 2) // tuple
```

<aside class="notes">
This last example is a **tuple**. A tuple is a type that represents data made up  of more than one value of any type.
</aside>
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Functions

From what you know using other programming languages, what's a function? ü§î
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
They let you enclose a block of code that performs a task. Then when you need to execute that block of code you can call the function to do it.

You can call the function as many times as you need from different places, instead of repeating code all over.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Here's one way to write a function in Swift.

```swift
func sayHello() {
  print("Hello World, this is me.")
}
```
<aside class="notes">
We declare functions with the keyword *func* followed by the name of the function (something meaningful) and followed by parenthesis. Inside we can have zero or more input parameters. In this case there aren't any. Then comes the body of the function enclosed by braces.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
We call the function like this:

```swift
sayHello() // prints "Hello World, this is me."
```
<!-- v -->

Sometimes we need to pass in values to be used inside the function. These are input **parameters** and go inside the parenthesis, specifying their type, like this:

```swift
func printSumOf(value:Int, andValue:Int) {
  print("\(value) + \(andValue) = \(value + andValue )")
}
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
When we call the function, we send the **arguments** it needs to work.

```swift
printSumOf(value:4, andValue:8)
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
*Apple's convention*

Try to make your functions read as sentences. This makes it easier to understand what they do. You'll see a lot of Swift documentation written like this.

"Print sum of value 4 and value 8"
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
We can make it more readable if we use external names.

```swift
func printSumOf(value:Int, and value:Int) {
  print("\(value) + \(andValue) = \(value + andValue )")
}
printSumOf(value: 4, and: 8)
```
<aside class="notes">
*and* is the external name that we use when calling the function, while *value* remains as the internal name that we use in the body of the function.

Now it reads as "Print sum of value 4 and 8"
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You can also opt to have no external names and use an underscore.

```swift
func printSumOf(_ firstValue:Int, _ secondValue:Int) {
  print("\(firstValue) + \(secondValue) = \(firstValue + secondValue )")
}
printSumOf(4,8)
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You can also give parameters default values.

```swift
func printSumOf(_ firstValue:Int, _ secondValue:Int = 10) {
  print("\(firstValue) + \(secondValue) = \(firstValue + secondValue )")
}
```

**Q:** Can you figure out how to call the function to use the default value?
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Return values

So far we've seen functions that print out to console. But in most real life situations we'll need functions that return a value, so we can store it in a variable or use it directly in another operation.

```swift
func sumOf(_ firstValue:Int, and secondValue:Int) -> Int {
  return firstValue + secondValue
}

let result = sumOf(4, and: 8)
```

<aside class="notes">
We use -> followed by the type of the return value. Then inside the function we use a return statement to give back the resulting value.
