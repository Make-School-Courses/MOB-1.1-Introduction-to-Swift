## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Identify common elements in iOS apps
- Build a wireframe using native iOS components
- Understand the relationship between scenes, views and view controllers
- Familiarize with the concept of MVC
- Familiarize with Autolayout

## Keeping us updated


[iOS 13](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13/)

[Xcode 11](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

<aside class="notes">
iOS is the mobile operating system created by Apple Inc. It runs on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Macs, Apple Watch. There‚Äôs a new release every year.

Xcode is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, tvOS & watchOS.

## What is UIKit?

- The core framework that helps us build iOS apps.
- Has default core components (buttons, sliders, image views). Same look and feel.
- Provides a base app with functionality to start working with.
- Main components: **Scenes**, **View Controllers** and **Views**.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
‚ÄúThis framework lets apps achieve a **consistent appearance** across the system, while at the same time offering a high level of **customization**. UIKit elements are **flexible** and **familiar**. They‚Äôre adaptable, enabling you to design a single app that looks great on any iOS device, and they **automatically update when the system introduces appearance changes.**‚Äù
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How an app is made
Every app is made up of scenes and transitions between scenes.

![scenes](assets/scenes.png)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The first thing we need to do when creating a new app is to think:

- What can the app do?
- Where are things happening, in what scenes?
- How many scenes do we need?
- What are the possible transitions between scenes?
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Scenes**

Scenes consist of *View Controllers* and *Views*.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**View Controllers (VC)**

Are the containers for the views.

In most cases: one scene will have one view controller.

- Each view controller has one root view
- We can add more views as *subviews* to the root view of the view controller.
- View controllers are not something we can see, they need a view at least.
- Manage views
- Get informed about different system events (rotating, view appeared/disappeared)
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Views**

Anything that displays in the screen is a view.

They all share common properties (size, position, receive user input)

UIKit provides subclasses that represent components:
  - buttons
  - textfields
  - date pickers ...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### View lifecycle

Views have different stages: when they are created, shown, disappear and destroyed.

For every one of these stages, the View Controller associated with the view will receive an event that we can handle.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
`ViewDidLoad`

Called as soon as the view is loaded for the first time.

We can initialize properties here.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
`ViewWillAppear`/ `ViewDidAppear`

As soon as the view appears on screen.

The importance to differentiate them is if we are using animations to present views.

**Good place to load data.**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
`ViewWillDisappear`/ `ViewDidDisappear`

Good place to save data, clean up resources,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### View Hierarchy

(whiteboard)
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Question

What is the main distinction between a view and a view control?

<!--view displays information, view control responds to user interaction-->

## Building a wireframe

Let's say we want to turn the "Boba Shop" program into a real app.

1. Think about the scenes the app needs.

2. Draw the elements each scene needs.
    - every element must be a native component of UIKit. Refer to the [Interface Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/) You should be able to name every element in your scenes.

3. Draw the transitions between scenes. How do I get to each scene?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Share in pairs your designs.

- Any similar components?
- Major differences?
- Give each other feedback on what might be a better practice.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## MVC

![mvc](assets/mvc.png)
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Autolayout

Auto Layout **dynamically calculates** the size and position of all the views in the view hierarchy, **based on constraints** placed on those views.

This constraint-based approach to design allows you to build user interfaces that dynamically respond to both internal and external changes.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### External changes
Occur when the size or shape of your superview changes. And we must update the layout of the view hierarchy to best use the available space.

- The user enters or leaves Split View on an iPad
- The device rotates
- We want to support different orientations
- We want to support different screen sizes
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Internal changes

Occur when the size of the views or controls in the user interface change.

- The content displayed by the app changes
- The app supports internationalization
- The app supports Dynamic Type
