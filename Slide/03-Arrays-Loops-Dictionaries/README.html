## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- **Create** Arrays to store collections of data
- **Create** Dictionaries to store collections of data
- **Differentiate** & use the various types of loops in Swift
- **Apply** Optionals in creating and using different collection types
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Arrays

The most common collection type in Swift.

Collections are containers that let us store multiple values together.

Arrays store multiple values **of the same type** in a list.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
An **ordered** collection of values **of the same type**

Arrays are **zero-indexed**.

![array](assets/array.png)

<aside class="notes">
Zero-indexed means the index of the first element is always 0, the second is 1, third is 2 and so on.

The last element has an index equal to the number of values in the array minus one.

In the example above, there are 4 elements of type String. Their indices go from 0 to 3.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Creating an array

Using an **array literal**

```swift
let concentrations = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]
```

The type is `[String]`

<aside class="notes">
An array literal is a list of values separated by commas, inside square brackets.

The type inside the square brackets tell us the type of values the array can store.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Creating an empty array

`var concentrations = []`

```swift
Empty collection literal requires an explicit type
```

If we need an empty array, we need to specify it's type since Xcode can't infer it.

Here's two ways to do it.

`var concentrations : [String] = []`

`var concentrations = [String]()`
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Appending elements

We can add elements to an array using different methods:

```swift
concentrations.append("ROB")
concentrations += ["ROB"]
concentrations.insert("ROB", at: 2)
```
<aside class="notes">
The append method will add the new element at the end of the array.

+= operator will also add it at the end.

The insert method lets us define the position in the array where we want the new element.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Removing elements

There are several alternatives to remove elements.

```swift
concentrations.removeLast()
concentrations.remove(at:4)
```

<aside class="notes">
Both methods will do two things, they will remove the element while also returning it in case you need to store it and use it.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updating elements

There are several alternatives to remove elements.

```swift
concentrations[0] = "MOBILE"
```

<aside class="notes">
Here we use the subscript syntax to update the content.

Important: Be sure to NOT use an index that goes beyond the bounds of the array. Or else the program will crash.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Swapping

```swift
concentrations.swap(1,2)
```

<aside class="notes">
The swap method lets us exchange the position of two elements.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sorting

```swift
concentrations.sort()
concentrations.sorted()
```
<aside class="notes">
The sort method will order the elements in the array.

The sorted method will return a sorted copy of the array.
</aside>

## Challenge

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]
```

Write a function that takes in an array and prints all the available tracks

Output:

```swift
We offer these concentrations: MOB,BEW,FEW,DS
```
Done early? Get ahead on this [Repl.it for Arrays](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/YcJWOag)


Solution

First approach solution

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]

func printConcentrations(concentrationsArray:[String]){
    print("We offer these concentrations: \(coursesAndStudents[0]),\(coursesAndStudents[1]),\(coursesAndStudents[2]),\(coursesAndStudents[3])")
}

printConcentrations(concentrationsArray: coursesAndStudents)
```


For loop solution

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]

func printConcentrations(concentrationsArray:[String]){
    var currentString = ""
    for course in coursesAndStudents{
        currentString += "\(course),"
    }
    print("We offer these concentrations: \(currentString.dropLast())")
}

printConcentrations(concentrationsArray: coursesAndStudents)
```

Find out what `dropLast` is doing and how you can use it with collections.


Another solution

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]

func printConcentrations(concentrationsArray:[String]){
    for (index, course) in concentrationsArray.enumerated() {
      print("\(index + 1). \(course)")
    }
}

printConcentrations(concentrationsArray: coursesAndStudents)
```

This option will not print the same sentence, it's mainly to see how you can use the method `enumerated` to get a tuple with both the index and the value of the element.

## Dictionaries

An **unordered** collection of **pairs**.

Each pair has a **key** and a **value**.

![dictionary](assets/dictionary.png)

<aside class="notes">
Keys are unique, they can't appear more than once in a dictionary.

All keys have to be of the same type and all values have to be of the same type.

Dictionaries are useful when when want to look up values given an identifier. Just like looking up words in a dictionary.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating a dictionary

Using a **dictionary literal**.

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB":30, "BEW":40, "FEW":30, "DS":40]
```

The type is `[String:Int]`

<aside class="notes">
A list of key-value pairs separated by commas inside square brackets.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating an empty dictionary

```swift
var coursesAndStudents : [String:Int] = [:]
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Accessing values in a dictionary

We can use subscripting just like in arrays. But since elements are not ordered, instead of looking for an index, we look for a key.

```swift
print(coursesAndStudents["FEW"]!)
```

Why are we using force unwrapping?

<aside class="notes">
The return type is an optional. Meaning the dictionary will first check if there is a value with the key provided. If there is it will return the value, nil otherwise.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Adding to and Updating a dictionary

```swift
coursesAndStudents.updateValue(15, forKey: "ROB")
coursesAndStudents["ROB"] = 15
```

<aside class="notes">
These both serve as a way to add a new pair and also to update an existing pair. The code will update the value for the key given or create a new pair if it can't find it.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Removing elements

```swift
coursesAndStudents.removeValue(forKey:"ROB")
coursesAndStudents["ROB"] = nil
```

<aside class="notes">
These will remove the key and the corresponding value from the dictionary.

There is a difference between the two methods. Assigning a key to nil will remove the value and the key entirely. If we wanted to keep the key and set the value to nil (in case we are dealing with optionals) we should use the removeValue method.
</aside>

<!--

## Challenge

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB":30, "BEW":40, "FEW":30, "DS":40]
```

Write a function that takes in a dictionary and prints how many students belong to a given track.

Output

```swift
There are 30 students in the MOB track
There are 40 students in the BEW track
There are 30 students in the FEW track
There are 40 students in the DS track
```

Done early? Get ahead on this - [Repl.it for Dictionaries](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/0J90Ejp)

Solution

First approach implementation

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB":30, "BEW":40, "FEW":30, "DS":40]
func printStudentcount(dictionary:[String:Int]){
    print("There are \(dictionary["MOB"]!) students in the MOB track")
    print("There are \(dictionary["BEW"]!) students in the BEW track")
    print("There are \(dictionary["FEW"]!) students in the FEW track")
    print("There are \(dictionary["DS"]!) students in the DS track")
}
printStudentcount(dictionary: coursesAndStudents)
```


For loop implementation
```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB":30, "BEW":40, "FEW":30, "DS":40]
for (course, countStudents) in coursesAndStudents {
  print("There are \(countStudents) students in the \(course) track")
}
```

Notice the use of more than one variable iterating in the for loop.

Built in `.forEach` method

```swift
func printStudentcount(dictionary:[String:Int]){
  dictionary.forEach {
    print("There are \($0.value) students in the \($0.key) track")
    }
}
printStudentcount(dictionary: coursesAndStudents)
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sets

An **unordered** collection of **unique** values of the same type.

```swift
let plantCollection: Set<String> = ["Pothos", "Monstera", "Calathea"]
let plantCollection = Set(["Pothos", "Monstera", "Calathea"])
```

<aside class="notes">
The first option uses a type annotation while the second one let's the compiler infer the type.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
let plantCollection: Set<String> = ["Pothos", "Monstera", "Calathea", "Pothos"]

print(plantCollection)
```

What will be the result in the console?

<aside class="notes">
The result will be an unordered list and it will also show unique values. So even if we added the same plant twice, the set will make sure all the elements are unique.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Finding elements in a Set

```swift
print(plantCollection.contains("Monstera"))
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Adding and removing elements

```swift
plantCollection.insert("Ficus")

let removedPlant = plantCollection.remove("Calathea")

## [**10m**] BREAK
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Loops
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## while loop

```swift
while <CONDITION> {
  // code that will loop
}
```

The loop checks the condition for every iteration. When the condition is false, it will stop.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## repeat-while loops

```swift
repeat {
  // code that will loop
} while <CONDITION>
```

The condition is evaluated at the end of the loop.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
var result = 0

while result < 5{
  result = result + (result + 1)
}
```

```swift
var result = 0

repeat{
  result = result + (result + 1)
} while result < 10
```

<aside class="notes">
What will be the result in each loop?
</aside
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
var result = 0

while true{
  result = result + (result + 1)
  if result >= 10{
    break
  }
}
```

We can end the loop using the `break` statement. It will stop the execution of the loop and continue with the code after the loop.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Countable ranges

`let closedRange = 0...8`

Goes from 0 to 8 inclusive.


`let halfOpenRange = 0..<8`

Goes from 0 up to, but not including 8.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## For loop

```swift
for <CONSTANT> in <RANGE> {
  // code that will loop
}
```

```swift
let count = 5
var result = 0
for i in 1...count{
  result += i
}
```
<aside class= "notes">
The for loop iterates from 1 tp 5, and each time it will update the value of result.

When working with loops that update the value of a variable it is useful to do a whiteboard test and check what is its value in each iteration.

Its important to notice that the constant i is only visible inside the scope of the for loop.
</aside>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Sometimes we don't need the loop constant, we just want to run a block of code certain number of times.

```swift
for _ in 0..count{
  // code that will loop
}
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
```swift
var result = 0
for i in 1...10 where i % 2 == 1 {
  result += i
}
```

This for loop has a where clause. It will loop through all of the values in the range but will only execute the block then the where condition is true.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Looping items in an array

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB", "BEW", "FEW", "DS"]
for course in coursesAndStudents {
  print(course)
}
```

Looping items in a dictionary

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = ["MOB":30, "BEW":40, "FEW":30, "DS":40]
for (course, countStudents) in coursesAndStudents {
  print("\(course): \(countStudents)")
}
```

<!--

## Challenge

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = [("MOB", 30), ("BEW", 40), ("FEW", 30), ("DS", 40)]
