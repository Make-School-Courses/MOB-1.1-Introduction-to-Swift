## Lab Practice

## The following problems are common interview questions. Answer them in a Swift Playground using what you know so far about Arrays, Dictionaries and Loops.


1. You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple. Print all the values from `colorHex`.

```
var colorHex: [String:String] = [
    "purple" : "#6C3483",
    "blue" : "#2874A6",
    "green": "#1E8449" ,
    "orange" : "#D35400",
    "yellow" : "#F1C40F",
    "white" : "#FFFFFF",
    "black" : "#000000"
]
```

2. Given an array of colors. We need to know how many times each color appears in the array.

`var colors = ["red", "orange", "purple", "pink", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "blue", "purple", "pink" , "purple", "purple"]`

Your solution should lead to this answer:

```
red - 3
orange - 1
purple - 4
pink - 2
blue - 2
green - 1
```

3. Write a function that returns the first N Fibonacci numbers.

Sequence: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13

```
func fibo(n: Int) -> [Int]

//example:

fibo(n: 7) -> [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]

fibo(n: 5) -> [1,1,2,3,5]
```

4. Write a function that prints the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to N.

5. Given:

```swift
var coursesAndStudents = [("MOB", 30), ("BEW", 40), ("FEW", 30), ("DS", 40)]
```

Write a function that prints how many students belong to each track.

Output:

```swift
There are 30 students in the MOB track
There are 40 students in the BEW track
There are 30 students in the FEW track
There are 40 students in the DS track
```

6. Write a function to check whether the first element and the last element of a given array of integers are equal. The array length must be 1 or more.

7. Write a function to compute the sum of all the elements of a given array of integers.

8. Write a function to rotate the elements of an array of integers to left direction. `[1,2,3]` becomes `[3,2,1]`

9. Write a function that accepts a String as its only parameter, and returns true if the string has
only unique letters.

10. Write a function that accepts a String and a character and returns how many times that specific character appears in the string.

11.  Given a Grid with the following numbers.

![grid](grid.png)

Write a function that adds up the elements in the even rows only, like this:

![grid2](grid2.png)
